A simple yet effective **content-based song recommendation system** built using a **Kaggle Spotify-inspired dataset**.  
The system recommends songs similar to the one selected by the user, using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Sigmoid Kernel** for similarity scoring.

## 📜 Overview

This project demonstrates how text-based features (song titles) can be used to recommend similar songs.  
While basic, it serves as a starting point for building more advanced hybrid recommendation systems that combine text, audio features, and user behavior.

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Music Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/) (Spotify-inspired)  
- Contains song details such as:
  - Title  
  - Artist  
  - Album  
  - Other metadata  



---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Scikit-learn** –  
  - `TfidfVectorizer` for text feature extraction  
  - `sigmoid_kernel` for similarity calculation  

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Load Dataset** – Import the Kaggle dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.  
2. **Vectorize Titles** – Convert song titles into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.  
3. **Calculate Similarity** – Use `sigmoid_kernel` to compute similarity scores between songs.  
4. **Recommend** – Select a song and retrieve the top N most similar songs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/song-recommendation.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd song-recommendation
```
## Future Improvements 🚀

- Integrate **Spotify audio features** (danceability, tempo, energy) to make recommendations more accurate.  
- Incorporate **lyrics embeddings** using Sentence-BERT for semantic similarity.  
- Develop a **web interface** with Streamlit or Gradio for an interactive experience.  
- Experiment with **hybrid recommendation systems** combining content-based and collaborative filtering.  
- Optimize performance for **large-scale datasets** with efficient vectorization and similarity calculations.
