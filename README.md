# Song Recommendation System üéµ

A simple **content-based song recommendation system** built using a Spotify-inspired dataset from Kaggle.  
The system recommends songs based on similarity of song titles using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **sigmoid kernel** for similarity scoring.

---

## Dataset

The dataset used is from Kaggle and contains song details such as:
- Title
- Artist
- Album
- Other metadata



---

## Features

- TF-IDF vectorization on song titles to convert text into numerical features.
- Similarity calculation using `sigmoid_kernel` from `sklearn.metrics.pairwise`.
- Functionality to select a song and get a list of **similar songs ranked by similarity score**.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/song-recommendation.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
```bash
cd song-recommendation
```
## Future Improvements üöÄ

- Integrate **Spotify audio features** (danceability, tempo, energy) to make recommendations more accurate.  
- Incorporate **lyrics embeddings** using Sentence-BERT for semantic similarity.  
- Develop a **web interface** with Streamlit or Gradio for an interactive experience.  
- Experiment with **hybrid recommendation systems** combining content-based and collaborative filtering.  
- Optimize performance for **large-scale datasets** with efficient vectorization and similarity calculations.
